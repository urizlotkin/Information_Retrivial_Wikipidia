# Information_Retrivial_Wikipidia

In this project (Information Retrivial final project) we created a Search Engine that works with Wikipidia English Corpus.
the main functuiality of the engine is to return an answer (list of relevant Wikipidia documents) for a given Query.

in this Repository we have those files:

1. Search_frontend : main engine code

-  In this code we are getting all of the relevant indexes that will help us to retrive the answer by a given Query.
-  In this code we have our Search functions that gets a Query, and returns the wanted result.
-  In this code we have some help functions that help us to read all the wanted Indexes (from the bucket), and also reading all the JSON files (pageRank, pageVieus).


2. Inverted_Index : Inverted Index Class

- Class with all the functions and attribiutes of the InvertedIndex.


3. IRP_creating_indexes : code for creation of the Indexes


4. test_search_engine : code for testing our Search Engine
